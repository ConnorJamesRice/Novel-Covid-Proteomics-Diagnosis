# Project Title: Covid Proteomics for diagnosis

## Description
This project involves the construction of a dataset to perform three main tasks:
1. Construct an appropriate dataset
1. Generate a Volcano Plot
2. Perform Logistic Regression

The main objective of this project is to identify the optimal collection of proteins for a COVID-19 diagnostic panel.

## Files
1. `Main.py`: This is the main script that you should run. It contains the code for data processing, analysis, and visualization.
2. `thought_process.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook contains detailed explanations and thought processes behind each step of the project. It's a walkthrough of the dataset and the reasoning behind each step of the analysis. I would like to make a note that this dataset was originally collected for a covid mortality study, but I wanted to see if it could also be used for diagnosis.
